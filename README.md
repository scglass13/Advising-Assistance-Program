# Advising-Assistance-Program
**CS300-DSA: Analysis and Design Project**

1. What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
   - The goal of the projects in this course was to write a program for academic advisors to use that can keep track of student courses and their prerequisites. 
2. How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
   - Before writing any code, I had to determine which data structure I would use to store the course information. I had to consider the efficiency of each data structure before I concluded that a hash table would make the most sense. 
3. How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
   - The project was very challenging and I got stuck many times. I often had to refer to text books, documentation, online forums (StackOverflow, Quora, etc.), and YouTube to come up with solutions to the challenges. 
4. How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
   - Before working on this project, I had little to no experience working with any of the data structures covered in this course. However, after the coding assignments and projects, I have a solid understanding of each data structure as well as the runtime efficiency of each. 
5. How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
   - Working on this project has helped me understand how powerful object-oriented programming can be. I think creating and using classes helps keep the code DRY and allows other developers to easily create new instances of the classes instead of writing excessive code.
